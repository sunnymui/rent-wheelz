Here's a step-by-step plan to create a Next.js project with a mock database using lowdb:

1. **Setup the Next.js project**
   - Install Node.js and npm if not already installed.
   - Install create-next-app using the command `npm install -g create-next-app`.
   - Create a new Next.js application using the command `npx create-next-app car-rental-app`.

2. **Setup lowdb for the mock database**
   - Navigate to the project directory using `cd car-rental-app`.
   - Install lowdb using the command `npm install lowdb`.
   - Create a `db.json` file in the root of your project. This will act as your database file.
   - 
   ```js
   const low = require('lowdb')
   const FileSync = require('lowdb/adapters/FileSync')

   const adapter = new FileSync('db.json')
   const db = low(adapter)

   // Then you can use db to interact with your data

   // create
   db.get('posts')
   .push({ id: 1, title: 'lowdb is awesome'})
   .write();

      // read
   let post = db.get('posts')
   .find({ id: 1 })
   .value();

      // update
   db.get('posts')
   .find({ id: 1 })
   .assign({ title: 'lowdb is really awesome' })
   .write();

      // delete
   db.get('posts')
   .remove({ id: 1 })
   .write();

   // .write saves database changes to db.json
   ```

3. **User Registration**
   - Create a `register.js` file in the `pages/api` directory.
   - In this file, setup an API route that accepts POST requests. This route will receive the user's information from the request body, generate a unique ID for the user, and store the user's information in the `db.json` file.

4. **User Login**
   - Create a `login.js` file in the `pages/api` directory.
   - In this file, setup an API route that accepts POST requests. This route will receive the user's credentials from the request body, validate them against the data in the `db.json` file, and return a response indicating whether the login was successful or not.

5. **Search for Cars**
   - Add a list of cars to the `db.json` file. Each car should have a unique ID, a name, a status indicating whether it's available or not, and any other relevant information.
   - Create a `search.js` file in the `pages/api` directory.
   - In this file, setup an API route that accepts GET requests. This route will receive the search parameters from the request query, filter the cars in the `db.json` file based on these parameters, and return the matching cars.

6. **Book Cars**
   - Create a `book.js` file in the `pages/api` directory.
   - In this file, setup an API route that accepts POST requests. This route will receive the user's ID and the car's ID from the request body, update the car's status in the `db.json` file to indicate that it's not available, and store the booking information in the `db.json` file.

7. **Cancel Reservations**
   - Create a `cancel.js` file in the `pages/api` directory.
   - In this file, setup an API route that accepts POST requests. This route will receive the user's ID and the car's ID from the request body, update the car's status in the `db.json` file to indicate that it's available, and remove the booking information from the `db.json` file.

8. **Frontend**
   - Create the necessary pages and components for the user interface. Use Next.js's built-in `fetch` function to interact with the API routes you've created. For example, you might have a `Register` page that sends a POST request to `/api/register`, a `Login` page that sends a POST request to `/api/login`, a `Search` page that sends a GET request to `/api/search`, etc.
   - Here's a step-by-step plan to create the relevant UI pages, styles, and tests for this step using Next.js:

      - Create the Pages
         - Create a new file under the pages directory for each page you need. For example, register.js, login.js, and search.js.
         - In each file, create a functional component that returns the necessary JSX for that page.

      - Create the Components
         - Create a new file under the components directory for each reusable component you need. For example, Form.js, Button.js, etc.
         - In each file, create a functional component that returns the necessary JSX for that component.

      - Fetch Data from the API
         - Use the built-in fetch function in Next.js to interact with your API routes. For example, in your Search page, you might have a function that sends a GET request to /api/search.

      - Style the Pages and Components
         - Create a styles directory to hold your CSS files.
         - Create a CSS file for each page and component. For example, register.css, login.css, search.css, Form.css, Button.css, etc.
         - Import the relevant CSS file in each page and component file.

      - Create the Tests
         - Create a tests directory to hold your test files.
         - Create a test file for each page and component. For example, register.test.js, login.test.js, search.test.js, Form.test.js, Button.test.js, etc.
         - In each test file, write unit tests for the relevant page or component using a testing library like Jest.

      - Run the Tests
         - Run your tests using the npm test command in your terminal. Make sure all your tests pass.


Remember to run the application using `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to view it.
